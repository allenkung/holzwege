I've read a lot of philosophy books during my university time. It's a pleasure to show you my philosophy notes through this small project. You may also feel the power from the lines which somehow changed my life.

[Holzwege](http://book.douban.com/subject/3069178/) is a collection of some of [Martin Heidegger](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/马丁·海德格尔)'s most important essays from 1935 to 1946. The title for this essay comes from the distinction between two kinds of paths. One of these, called a Feldweg, is as its name says "a path to the field."
